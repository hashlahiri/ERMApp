      &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd promote the use of fair information practices. Because Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd are
      committed to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices.</p>
      <hr />
   <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE:</strong></p>
   <p>Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Om Decorators
      &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is

      different points on the web site.</p>
   <p><strong>PACKAGE QUOTE REQUESTS:</strong></p>
   <p>In order to obtain a customized package price quote, a user must first complete a Quote Request Form after
      registration and login, directly contacting the administrator. A user is required to give their contact
      information (such as name, message, telephone number and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the
      user and provide the quote or other information that they have requested. It is mandatory for the user to provide
      financial information, but can be done so that Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt Ltd can review and pre-qualify the user
      for financing if they are interested. All customer information(password) obtained via the registration request
      form is encrypted for security purposes and stored on a secured server.</p>
   <p><strong>ORDERS:</strong></p>
   <p>Information is requested from the user on the order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like
      name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information
      is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd has trouble
      processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. All customer information
      obtained via the order form is kept for security purposes and stored on a secured server.</p>
   <p><strong>COOKIES:</strong></p>
   <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's browser containing information about the user. Once the
      user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For example, a cookie is used to store items during login
      process so that a list of what you are ordering is maintained. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use
      the site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the
      user, may not be able to use the admin section on the site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the
      interests of our users to enhance the experience on the site.</p>
   <p><strong>SHARING:</strong></p>
   <p>We may share demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is generally not linked to any
      personal information that can identify any individual person. However, Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd may send
      E-mails or mail about special offers at the Dealership via newsletter service or other offers or information that
      may be of interest to the user based on the information we collect.</p>
   <p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will
      share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These
      parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these
      services.</p>
   <p><strong>LINKS:</strong></p>
   <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd are not
      responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements
      of every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
      information collected by this web site.</p>
   <p><strong>SURVEY AND CONTESTS:</strong></p>
   <p>From time to time, our newsletter service might request information from users via surveys or may offer
      contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
      whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name
      and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be
      used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
      improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
   <p><strong>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES:</strong></p>
   <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so our users are always aware of
      what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
   <p><strong>SECURITY:</strong></p>
   <p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive
      information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
   <p>When our quote request or order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as card number), that
      information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a
      secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
      Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just "surfing".</p>
   <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
      user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, has
      restricted access at Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd and at the dealership. Only employees who need the
      information to perform a specific job (for example, order clerk, sales representative, or a customer service
      representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Access to the information is made via a
      password-protected site. Each time an employee needs to access information, they must enter their password to gain
      access to the information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
      Employees are periodically notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do
      to ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>
   <p><strong>SUPPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION:</strong></p>
   <p>In order for this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us
      to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources.</p>
   <p>For example, to determine if customers qualify for financing, the dealership may use their name and card number to
      request a credit report or approval from a lending institution.</p>
   <p><strong>SITE AND SERVICE UPDATES:</strong></p>
   <p>Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd may send the user site and service announcement updates which contain
      important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard
      to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.</p>
   <p><strong>CORRECTING / UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION:</strong>
   <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as
      address or E-mail), or if a user no longer desires to receive information from Om Decorators &amp; DJ Pvt. Ltd,
      contact the administrator and we will endeavor to correct, update or remove that user's personal data from our
      database.</p>
